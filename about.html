			<h1> About Us </h1>
			<p> Since 2020, our realstate groupe HB companies have been renting homes to New Yorkers looking for quality apartments at competitive prices. Our  family-oriented approach to ownership and management allows us to treat each resident with a practiced level of courtesy and assistance.
			<br>
			<br>

			Our goal is to make you feel at home. Whether you are searching for a pet-friendly NYC building, a no fee apartment (when you rent directly from us) or a home suitable for your family, roommate or just yourself, we offer a space for every need. With residential buildings in Manhattan, Queens and The Bronx, we offer a diverse portfolio comprised of more than fifty properties and nearly one thousand apartments.
